# Third-Party Notices

The TinyAya Stage 2 source code is licensed under Apache-2.0 (see `LICENSE`).
This project, however, **builds on third-party models, datasets, and
libraries that are governed by their own licenses**. Everyone using or

## Models / weights

| Component | Source | License | What you must know |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------------------|
| **Cohere `tiny-aya` backbone** | CohereLabs / Cohere | **Cohere model license** (NOT Apache-2.0) | This repo ships **LoRA adapter deltas only**, never the base weights. To run/train you must obtain the base model directly and comply with Cohere's license (including any non-commercial / acceptable-use terms). |
| **Moshi / Mimi (depth decoder + audio codec)** | [kyutai-labs/moshi](https://github.com/kyutai-labs/moshi) | MIT | Retain the MIT copyright/permission notice when redistributing derived weights. |
| **Whisper (alignment, data pipeline)** | OpenAI | MIT | Used for forced alignment in the data pipeline. |

## Datasets

The v0.3 corpus (`tr-hi-mimi-encoded`) is **synthetic**: source text from FLORES /
OPUS-100 / conversational MT, rendered to speech by TTS models, then Mimi-encoded. v0.2
used FLEURS. All sources below apply.

| Dataset / source | Source | License | What you must know |
|---------|--------|---------|--------------------|
| **FLORES** (source text) | Meta / NLLB | **CC BY-SA 4.0** | Attribution + share-alike on derived text. |
| **OPUS-100** (source text) | OPUS project | Per-subcorpus (mixed) | Check the specific subcorpus terms. |
| Conversational MT (source text) | Per-source | Per-source | Inherit each source's terms. |
| **TTS-model outputs** (synthetic speech) | kokoro / XTTS-v2 / chatterbox | Per-model terms | The synthetic audio inherits each TTS model's license/AUP. |
| **FLEURS** (v0.2 only) | Google | **CC BY 4.0** | Attribution required for redistribution of derived data. |
| `tiny-aya-translate/*` encoded datasets | HuggingFace Hub | See each dataset card | Derived from the above; inherit upstream obligations. |
