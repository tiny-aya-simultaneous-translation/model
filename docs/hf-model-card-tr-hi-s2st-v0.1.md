> (FLORES + OPUS-100 + machine-translated conversational text, rendered with
> multi-voice TTS; **1,178,302** train / 62,036 val pairs, verified from the

# TinyAya Stage 2 — Turkish ↔ Hindi Speech-to-Speech Translation (LoRA)

Stage-2 simultaneous-translation adapter for Turkish↔Hindi **speech-to-speech**
translation, trained on TPU v6e-8. This repo ships the authors' **trained
deltas only** — a LoRA adapter over `CohereLabs/tiny-aya-base` plus the
custom projection / Moshi depth-decoder / audio-head / embedding tensors.

- **Developed by:** [tiny-aya-translate](https://huggingface.co/tiny-aya-translate)
- **Funded by:** Google **TPU Research Cloud (TRC)** — see [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements)
- **Model type:** parallel two-stream S2ST (Cohere2 + LoRA + custom heads; frozen Moshi depth decoder)
- **Languages:** Turkish (`tr`), Hindi (`hi`)
- **License:** Apache-2.0 *(trained deltas + code only — see license scope below)*
- **Finetuned from:** `CohereLabs/tiny-aya-base` (+ Moshi / Mimi from Kyutai)
- **Newer version:** [`tiny-aya-translate/tr-hi-s2st-v0.2`](https://huggingface.co/tiny-aya-translate/tr-hi-s2st-v0.2)

## What this is

| | |
|---|---|
| Task | TR↔HI speech-to-speech translation (Moshi inner-monologue, hierarchical codebook decode) |
| Base | `CohereLabs/tiny-aya-base` + Moshi depth decoder + Mimi codec |
| Method | LoRA (+ trained projection/heads/embeds), bf16, FSDPv2 SPMD |
| Hardware | Cloud TPU v6e-8 (single host), via Google TRC |
| Steps | 15,000 (effective batch 256) |
| Data | [`tiny-aya-translate/tr-hi-mimi-encoded`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiny-aya-translate/tr-hi-mimi-encoded) — Mimi-encoded **synthetic** TR↔HI parallel speech (FLORES + OPUS-100 + conversational MT, multi-voice TTS); ~1.18M train pairs |

## Training procedure

- **Init**: LoRA (r=16) on the `tiny-aya-base` backbone; Moshi depth decoder
  initialized from `kyutai/moshiko`; projection / per-codebook audio heads /
  audio & text embeddings trained from scratch.
- **Recipe**: effective batch 256 (b=8 × grad-accum 4 × 8 chips), bf16,
  FSDPv2 SPMD, cosine LR (lr_lora 1.5e-4), 500 warmup steps, `max_frames=300`,
  8 codebooks, hierarchical codebook loss (text_weight 0.1, audio_weight 1.0).
- **Compute**: single-host Cloud TPU v6e-8 (spot), ~22 h, 15,000 steps
  (≈ 3.3 epochs over 1,178,302 train pairs).

**Convergence note (honest):** the **audio** loss plateaued by ~step 8,000
(≈1.7 epochs) and did not improve over the final 7k steps. The **text /
inner-monologue** stream did not learn in this run (loss ≈ random), pending
a data-pipeline fix. So this checkpoint reflects the audio-translation
capability of the recipe at convergence, not an under-trained model.
**This is fixed in [v0.2](https://huggingface.co/tiny-aya-translate/tr-hi-s2st-v0.2)**
(the text-padding-weighted loss), where the text stream learns.

## Evaluation

Speech-translation quality is measured with **ASR-BLEU** (Whisper transcribes
the generated target audio, BLEU vs. reference target text) and **DNSMOS**
(naturalness). ASR-BLEU is implemented in `scripts/eval_checkpoint.py`; DNSMOS
is not yet wired up. **Pending for this release** (`v0.1.0`); will be filled in
the YAML `model-index` + below.

| Metric | tr→hi | hi→tr | overall |
|--------|-------|-------|---------|
| ASR-BLEU | _TBD_ | _TBD_ | _TBD_ |
| DNSMOS (ovrl) | _TBD_ | _TBD_ | _TBD_ |

## Intended use & limitations

- **Intended**: research on low-resource speech-to-speech translation and
  simultaneous translation; a Stage-2 checkpoint, not a production system.
- **Limitations**: trained on **synthetic multi-voice TTS** audio (FLORES /
  OPUS-100 / conversational text) — expect degradation on real, spontaneous, or
  noisy audio and on voices outside the TTS set; two language directions only;
  **the text stream did
  not learn in this version** (root cause found 2026-07-08: a loader path bug —
  the corpus's word-level alignments ship under `{stem}.{src,tgt}.alignments.json`
  at the dataset root, which the v0.1 loader never resolved, so text supervision
  was silently all-padding; fixed in v0.3); generation is autoregressive
  and not optimized for latency here.
- **Bias & risks**: a fixed set of TTS voices — fairness across real speakers,
  dialects, accents, code-switching, and spontaneous speech is untested. Speech
  translation can mistranslate, omit, or fabricate content; not for high-stakes use.

## Inference quickstart

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from peft import PeftModel

BASE = "CohereLabs/tiny-aya-base"  # obtain per Cohere license
ADAPTER = "tiny-aya-translate/tr-hi-s2st-v0.1"  # this repo

tok = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(BASE, trust_remote_code=True)
base = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(BASE, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, trust_remote_code=True)
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base, ADAPTER)  # loads adapter_model.safetensors

# Then attach the custom heads (projection / depth_decoder / audio_heads /
# text_embed / model_audio_embed *.pt) and the Mimi codec; see the training
# repo for the full composite + generation loop.
```

The full speech→speech pipeline (Mimi encode → backbone+depth-decoder →
Mimi decode) lives in the training repo (`src/model/composite.py`).

## Version history

Versions are **git tags** in this repo (HF convention: one checkpoint per
repo, versioned with tags). Load a specific one with `revision=`:

```python
PeftModel.from_pretrained(base, "tiny-aya-translate/tr-hi-s2st-v0.1", revision="v0.1.0")
```

| Version | Step | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| `v0.1.0` | 15,000 | First release. Audio converged ~step 8k; text stream not yet learning; eval pending. |

When a materially different model is trained (new data / architecture), it
goes in a **new repo** — here, [`tr-hi-s2st-v0.2`](https://huggingface.co/tiny-aya-translate/tr-hi-s2st-v0.2)
(the `new_version:` field shows a forward banner on the Hub).
