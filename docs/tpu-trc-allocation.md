# TRC TPU allocation -- authoritative record

## 2026-05-13 update

Topology pivot: the **validated production path is now single-host TPU
v6e-8 in
`europe-west4-a`** (QR `tinyaya-stage2-spot-v6e8-eu-qr`, node
`tinyaya-stage2-spot-v6e8-eu`, profile shorthand `v6e-8-eu` in
`scripts/tpu/launch_spot.sh`). Iter 24h completed 5000/5000 baseline
steps on this profile and uploaded
`gs://tinyaya-stage2-eu/checkpoints/stage2-tpu-v6e-spot/step_005000_final/`.
The optimized `opt-prod5k` run then completed 5000/5000 steps with
checkpoint
`gs://tinyaya-stage2-eu/checkpoints/stage2-tpu-v6e-spot-opt-prod5k/step_005000_final/`.
Phase 4 activation/depth sweeps now start from the same v6e-8 EU
profile; `opt-4-depth32` completed its 300-step gate on this profile
with exit 0.
The v4-32 spot in `us-central2-b` ran iter 1-11 and is now legacy.
The TRC allocation table below has not changed -- but the **selected
zone / tier for daily operation** has pivoted to v6e-8 spot in
`europe-west4-a`. The allocation table, decision tree, and policy text
below remain authoritative for the full quota grant; they are simply
augmented by the production-validated choice to run on v6e-8 spot.
v6e-64 in `europe-west4-a` is the next scale-up target once spot
capacity allows.

**Status:** Active
**Captured:** 2026-05-05
**Recipient:** `mayankbhaskar007@gmail.com`
**GCP project:** `ml-pipelines-315702`
**Grant duration:** 90 days (free Cloud TPU usage; non-TPU GCP services
still billed; Google may reclaim capacity at any time)
**Source:** TRC welcome email from `trc-support@google.com` (subject
"You have access to free Cloud TPUs"), pasted by the user on
2026-05-05 and archived verbatim in this document.

This file is the **single source of truth** for which TPU types,
zones, and tiers we are entitled to. The older table in
`docs/tpu-launch-plan.md` §2 is **SUPERSEDED** by this document; that
section now points here.

## 1. Allocation table

| Quantity | TPU type | Zone | Tier |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 32 chips | Cloud TPU v4 | `us-central2-b` | **spot** |
| 32 chips | Cloud TPU v4 | `us-central2-b` | **on-demand** |
| 64 chips | Cloud TPU v5e | `europe-west4-b` | spot |
| 64 chips | Cloud TPU v5e | `us-central1-a` | spot |
| 64 chips | Cloud TPU v6e | `europe-west4-a` | spot |
| 64 chips | Cloud TPU v6e | `us-east1-d` | spot |

The dual v4 lines in `us-central2-b` are independent quotas: 32 chips
of on-demand AND 32 chips of spot in the same zone.
`v6e-8-eu` is a smaller single-host slice requested against the v6e
spot capacity in `europe-west4-a`; it is not a separate TRC grant row.

### Profile shorthands

`scripts/tpu/launch_spot.sh` accepts the following `TRC_PROFILE`
values, each mapping to a single row above:

| `TRC_PROFILE` | TPU type passed to `gcloud` | Zone | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `v6e-8-eu` (current production profile) | `v6e-8` | `europe-west4-a` | Single-host 8-chip slice validated by iter 24h and `opt-prod5k`; fits external-IP quota and avoids multi-host rendezvous. |
| `v4-32-uc2b` | `v4-32` | `us-central2-b` | Same zone as on-demand v4 quota; smallest legacy v4 fallback. |
| `v5e-64-ew4b` | `v5litepod-64` | `europe-west4-b` | Largest v5e slice; matches v5litepod-* canary tuning. |
| `v5e-64-uc1a` | `v5litepod-64` | `us-central1-a` | Same chip family as `v5e-64-ew4b`, US zone. |
| `v6e-64-ew4a` | `v6e-64` | `europe-west4-a` | Newest gen; needs `v2-alpha-tpuv6e` runtime. |
| `v6e-64-ue1d` | `v6e-64` | `us-east1-d` | Same as above, US zone. |

The on-demand v4 quota does not need a profile here -- it is already
the default of `scripts/tpu/launch_qr.sh` (no `--spot`).

## 2. Important caveats (verbatim from the email)

> This free 90-day trial is only available for new Cloud TPUs you
> create in the zones listed above. To avoid charges, please be sure
> to create your Cloud TPUs in the appropriate zone.

> While your Cloud TPUs are free, you'll still be charged for the
> rest of the GCP services you use. If you have a new account, Google
> Cloud's $300 USD introductory credit may completely offset these
> costs, and you can minimize costs even more by utilizing the new
> Cloud TPU VM architecture.

> Please note that demand for Cloud TPUs is high, so we can't
> guarantee you'll get to use all of your TPU quota. Google reserves
> the right to reclaim TRC quota and TRC Cloud TPU capacity at any
> time.

> If you have access to both on-demand and preemptible quotas, we
> recommend preferring on-demand and falling back to preemptible
> if/when on-demand is not available.

> If you have access to v2-8 and/or v3-8 quotas, please be aware
> that these individual devices cannot be used in pod configurations.
> *(Not applicable to this grant -- no v2/v3 quotas.)*

> If you encounter an error message indicating that your quota is
> exhausted, confirm that you have deleted any unused Cloud TPUs
> and/or Queued Resources that may still be consuming quota.

## 3. How to pick a zone (decision tree)

```text
Is the on-demand v4 quota in us-central2-b free right now?
+-- Yes -> use the on-demand path (existing launch_qr.sh defaults; no --spot)
+-- No  -> launch_spot.sh; pick TRC_PROFILE based on goal:
          +-- "I want minimal infra change" .................. v4-32-uc2b (default)
          +-- "I want maximum throughput on v5e family" ...... v5e-64-ew4b
          +-- "I am US-based and want low latency" ........... v5e-64-uc1a OR v6e-64-ue1d
          +-- "I want the validated production path" ......... v6e-8-eu
          +-- "I want to test newest multi-host hardware" .... v6e-64-ew4a OR v6e-64-ue1d
          +-- "Probe / smoke test only, smallest cost" ....... v4-32-uc2b (still smallest in this grant)
```

**Operational default for this repo's active TPU work:** `v6e-8-eu`. It uses one
host with eight chips, fits the current external-IP quota, and is the
only profile that has completed both the iter 24h baseline and
`opt-prod5k`. The script-level fallback default remains
`v4-32-uc2b` for historical compatibility, but active production and
optimization commands set `TRC_PROFILE=v6e-8-eu` explicitly.
