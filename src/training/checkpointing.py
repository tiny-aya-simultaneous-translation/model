"""Save/load mixed PEFT + full checkpoints for ``TinyAyaMoshiComposite``.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The composite mixes three kinds of weights:

1. PEFT-LoRA adapters on the Cohere backbone -- saved via
   ``model.backbone.model.save_pretrained`` (HF/PEFT convention).
2. Full-FT weights on the last two backbone layers -- captured by
   the same PEFT save (PEFT preserves any frozen ``requires_grad=True``
   tensors as well).
3. Plain PyTorch modules (``projection``, ``depth_decoder``,
   ``text_embed``, ``audio_heads``) -- saved as standalone ``.pt``
   files.

A standard ``model.state_dict()`` round-trip would silently drop the
PEFT adapter metadata and corrupt the freeze pattern; we save each
component explicitly to avoid that.

GPU vs TPU note
---------------
The TPU backend's ``save_checkpoint`` uses ``xm.save`` which gathers
all SPMD shards onto host CPU before writing. The functions in this
module run on host CPU after that gather, so they are device-agnostic.
``load_checkpoint`` always loads to CPU and lets the caller move
weights back to the target device.

    """End-of-training canonical save for FSDPv2-wrapped XLA models.

    DESTRUCTIVE: this function moves the entire wrapped model from the
    XLA device onto host CPU, which destroys FSDPv2 sharding metadata.
    Training cannot continue after this call -- only invoke at the
    final step. All hosts MUST call this function (``model.to("cpu")``
    is an SPMD-wide gather; the gather hangs forever if any host skips
    it). Only the global primary writes files.

    Why this exists
    ---------------
    Iters 9, 10, 11 all reached step 100 then deadlocked all 4 hosts
    at ``futex_wait_queue`` inside ``PEFT.save_pretrained``, even after
    patches 14/16/17 made every host build a CPU state_dict and pass
    it via ``state_dict=peft_state``. Root cause (per HF transformers
    issue #36004, closed Dec 2025): ``save_pretrained`` does not
    support saving models that are still resident on a TPU device --
    it internally re-walks the model's submodules, which on FSDPv2
    triggers XLA collectives that the global state cannot satisfy.
    The canonical fix is to call ``model.to("cpu")`` on the full
    wrapped model (gathering all shards in a single collective) BEFORE
    calling save_pretrained. After that, save_pretrained walks an
    ordinary CPU module with no XLA tensors involved.

    The trade-off is that ``model.to("cpu")`` is destructive on
    FSDPv2: the SPMD partitioner forgets the per-layer mesh
    annotations, and re-running ``backend.wrap_model(model)`` would
    not reproduce the original sharding without a fresh recompile.
    For our canary loop that is acceptable -- we save once at step
    ``max_steps`` and exit.

    GPU vs TPU note
    ---------------
    On non-XLA backends this function delegates to ``save_checkpoint``
