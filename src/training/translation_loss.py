"""Hierarchical translation loss: target-only CE on text + N audio codebooks.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The composite predicts both text and ``num_codebooks`` audio token
streams. The translation training only supervises the *target*
positions (the second half of each sample, after ``loss_mask`` flips
to 1). Loss is the weighted sum of:

* a single text cross-entropy over the target positions,
* the per-codebook mean cross-entropy over the target positions.

The next-token shift convention is ``logits[:, :-1] vs targets[:, 1:]``
applied symmetrically to the text and audio streams.

GPU vs TPU
----------
The function is plain PyTorch ``F.cross_entropy`` calls; XLA traces
each call into HLO ``select`` + ``log_softmax`` ops with no special
treatment required. The ``per_codebook`` Python loop unrolls into
``num_codebooks`` HLO subgraphs at compile time -- a one-time cost
because the codebook dimension is small (8) and stable.
