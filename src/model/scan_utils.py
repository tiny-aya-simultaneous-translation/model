"""XLA-aware ``scan_layers`` and gradient-checkpointing for HF transformers.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Two concrete problems that bite GPU engineers the moment their model
touches a TPU:

1. **XLA compile time blows up with unrolled transformer stacks.**
   On a GPU, PyTorch eagerly executes 36 ``CohereDecoderLayer`` calls
   in a Python ``for`` loop and the GPU just runs them. On a TPU, the
   first forward pass has to be *traced* into a single XLA HLO graph,
   compiled to TPU machine code, and only then executed. Tracing 36
   identical decoder layers produces 36 copies of the same subgraph
   in the HLO; the XLA optimiser has to walk through all of it. We
   measured 25+ minutes of compile on the 5.17B composite model
   (see PROGRESS 2026-05-03T14:30:00Z).

   ``torch_xla.experimental.scan_layers.scan_layers`` solves this by
   compiling **one** layer's HLO and running it ``N`` times via
   ``xla.while_loop``. The HLO graph stays roughly constant in size as
   the number of layers grows. This is the TPU analogue of GPU
   "kernel re-use": you pay the lowering cost once.

2. **Activation memory under SPMD is per-chip and unforgiving.**
   On a single-GPU GPU run, you can dial up batch size until the GPU
   OOMs, see the OOM, and lower it. On a TPU pod under SPMD, *every
   chip OOMing kills the whole job*; there is no "single chip" in the
   user-facing programming model. So we want gradient checkpointing
   on by default for the layer stacks. ``torch.utils.checkpoint`` with
   ``use_reentrant=False`` is XLA-compatible in torch 2.9 and works
   inside ``scan_layers``' loop body.

THE PROXY PATTERN
-----------------
HuggingFace's ``Cohere2Model.forward`` (and friends) iterates layers
with code like::

    for decoder_layer in self.layers[: self.config.num_hidden_layers]:
        layer_outputs = decoder_layer(
            hidden_states,
            attention_mask=causal_mask,
            position_ids=position_ids,
            position_embeddings=position_embeddings,
            ...
        )
        hidden_states = layer_outputs[0]

Re-implementing that whole ``forward`` to call ``scan_layers`` directly
would lock us to a specific HF transformers version. Instead, we swap
``self.layers`` (a ``nn.ModuleList``) for a ``_ScannedLayerStack``
proxy. The proxy implements ``__getitem__(slice(...))`` so that
``self.layers[:N]`` returns **a one-element list** containing a single
"fused" layer. HF's outer for-loop iterates exactly once; the fused
layer runs all ``N`` original layers inside ``scan_layers``.

GPU PATH IS A NO-OP
-------------------
On GPU/CPU, ``scan_layers`` is not imported (``PJRT_DEVICE`` is unset),
the proxy falls back to the manual loop, and gradient checkpointing
runs through ``torch.utils.checkpoint``. So the same composite model
class works on both backends without branching.

    GPU analogue: ``torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint(fn, *args)`` with

    On torch 2.9 + torch_xla 2.9 the non-reentrant variant works on
    XLA: the saved-tensors hooks are device-agnostic and the
    recomputation pass re-traces the forward inside the backward. We

    """Adapter that closes over an HF decoder layer's loop-invariant kwargs.

    WHY THIS EXISTS
    ---------------
    ``torch_xla.experimental.scan_layers.scan_layers`` in torch_xla 2.9
    has the signature ``scan_layers(layers, input_data, partition_fn=...,
    is_layer_pure=...)``. It does **not** accept arbitrary ``**kwargs``
    -- and yet HuggingFace's ``Cohere2Model.forward`` passes
    ``attention_mask``, ``position_embeddings``, ``position_ids`` (and
    sometimes ``cache_position``) to every layer call.

    Without this wrapper, the bare ``scan_fn(layers, hidden, **kwargs)``
    raises ``TypeError("scan_layers() got an unexpected keyword argument
    'attention_mask'")`` and the manual-loop fallback unrolls 36+6
    layers into the HLO, making backward compile take 4h+ (observed
    2026-05-05 on a v4-32 spot canary). With this wrapper, every layer
    is reduced to a uniform ``forward(hidden) -> hidden`` signature
    that ``scan_layers`` accepts, the kwargs become loop-invariant
    side inputs to the scan body, and compile drops to single-digit
    minutes.

    GPU ANALOGUE
    ------------
    Same idea as ``functools.partial`` for an nn.Module: the closure
    captures the loop-invariant tensors so the inner step has a clean
    one-tensor-in-one-tensor-out signature.

    lowering with ``Dynamic update slice: operand PRED vs update BF16``.

    THE FIX
    -------
    Express dropout as plain composed ops and cast the mask to the activation
    dtype *immediately*, so the tensor saved for backward is bf16 in both the
    abstract trace and the lowered graph. Numerics are identical to
    ``nn.Dropout`` (inverted dropout: ``x * mask / (1 - p)``).

    TPU note: only swapped in when the backbone runs under ``scan``; GPU/CPU
    and unrolled paths keep the stock ``nn.Dropout``. Inside scan's fused

    (masks correlated across layers) -- acceptable for LoRA-dropout

    """Run a homogeneous HF layer stack via torch_xla ``scan``, threading the

    WHY (the crux of the FakeTensor failures)
    -----------------------------------------
    ``scan_layers`` calls each layer with ONLY the carry (hidden state); the
    layer's other inputs (attention mask, RoPE ``position_embeddings``) have to
    be closed over. During scan's AOTAutograd *fake* trace those closed-over
    REAL tensors trip ``FakeTensorMode``'s non-fake-input assertion (the
    ``ones_like`` on the mask, the ``_tensor_constant0`` on cos/sin). The fix is
    to make those tensors part of the scan **carry**: scan fakeifies the carry
    (``torch.empty_like``) before tracing, so the trace sees fakes, while
    execution threads the real tensors through unchanged.

    Only FLOAT loop-invariants go in the carry -- scan forces ``requires_grad``
    on carry leaves and integer tensors (``position_ids``, ``cache_position``)
    cannot require grad. Those ints are left closed over; they are unused inside
    the layer once ``position_embeddings`` is supplied and full-attention is
    forced (see ``composite._force_full_attention_for_scan``), so they never hit
    the ops that assert.

    Activation memory: we pass ``min_cut_rematerialization_partition`` so scan
    checkpoints the layer body (recompute in backward) -- the memory win that
    lets the stack fit on one v6e-8 chip.

    Looks and acts like an ``nn.ModuleList`` for the bits HF cares
    about (``__len__``, ``__iter__``, ``__getitem__``), but rewrites
    the iteration protocol so the outer ``for`` loop in HF's forward
    yields exactly **one** fused layer that runs the whole stack via
    ``scan_layers``.

    Why not subclass ``nn.ModuleList``?
        ``nn.ModuleList.__getitem__(slice)`` returns a *new*
        ``ModuleList`` containing the slice, which would defeat the
        point. Subclassing it correctly is annoying. A plain
        ``nn.Module`` with the right magic methods is simpler and
        keeps parameter registration straightforward.

    Notes
    -----
    TPU note: HuggingFace also iterates ``self.layers`` to collect
    ``all_hidden_states`` when the caller passes
    ``output_hidden_states=True``. With this proxy in place that
    collection sees only the input and output of the whole stack
    (two snapshots), not 36 per-layer snapshots. For training that is
    fine; for probing hooks, disable the proxy by constructing the
    composite with ``use_scan_layers=False``.

    checkpoint *and* the loop fusion to keep compile time + HBM under
    control.

    Parameters
    ----------
    parent : nn.Module
        The HF model holding the layer stack as a child attribute.
        Common values:

        * ``backbone.model.model`` -- a ``Cohere2Model`` whose
          ``layers`` is a ``ModuleList[CohereDecoderLayer]``.
        * ``depth_decoder`` -- a ``MoshiDepthDecoder`` whose
          ``layers`` is a ``ModuleList[MoshiDecoderLayer]``.
    layer_attr : str
        Name of the attribute holding the layer stack. Almost always
        ``"layers"``.
    use_scan_layers : bool
        Forward to ``_ScannedLayerStack``. If False *and*
        ``use_grad_checkpoint`` is also False, this function returns
        ``False`` and does nothing -- no point paying for the proxy.
    use_grad_checkpoint : bool
        Forward to ``_ScannedLayerStack``. Recommended True on TPU.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        ``True`` if the swap happened, ``False`` if the call was a
        no-op (flags off, attribute missing, or already patched).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # Inside TinyAyaMoshiComposite.__init__:

    ...     self.backbone.model.model, "layers",
    ...     use_scan_layers=True, use_grad_checkpoint=True,

    TPU note: idempotent. Calling twice on the same parent is safe; we
